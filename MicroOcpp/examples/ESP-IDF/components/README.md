## Components folder structure

The ESP-IDF integration requires at least the following components:

- [MicroOcpp](https://github.com/matth-x/MicroOcpp)
- [Mongoose (ESP-IDF integration)](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose-esp-idf)
- [Mongoose adapter for MicroOcpp](https://github.com/matth-x/MicroOcppMongoose)
- [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)

This example only provides the folder structure. You need to clone every project into it in order to run the example.
